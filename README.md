# rock-image-share

Creating this dynamic page, I used Node, Express and some modules
like: Express Handlebars, Morgan, Multer, moment and others as
well as a bit of jquery. I used Mongoose to connect to MongoDB.
For the styles I have used Bootstrap 4 and font-awesome, but
recently I changed bootstrap to pure css. I was learning how to
upload images at the time I created this page, I learn how to do
it with Multer and I send them to Cloudinary.

This project runs on local port 3300.
It also has local variables for cloudinary and mongo db

I deployed it on Heroku.
